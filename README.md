The architecture and development approach known as the Jamstack enables teams of any size to **develop apps at any scale** at speeds that seem unbelievable â€” all while _improving_ reliability and maintainability and reducing overhead.

This workshop will dive deep into the fine mechanics of the Jamstack and teach you how adopting its architecture enables your team to build and ship faster.
